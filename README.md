1: I'll choose "Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed". The reason I didn't choose "Manually run them locally before pushing code" is that it could be a waste of time to manually test it and people could forget it sometime. As for "Run them all after all development is completed", by running all at once, you could do some stupid mistake which casue all the following code don't work and that is probably not a great idea. Therefore i choose the first one because it is more convinent and reliable.

3:No, unit tests are for testing the function. We should use End-to-end tests instead.

4:Yes, since it only need to test one individual part.
